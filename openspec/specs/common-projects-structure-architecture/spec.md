# Common-Projects-Structure-Architecture Specification

## Purpose

Records the architectural and documentation-related constraints which every change to a product that uses the common project
structure has to respect. They are not derivable from the source-code itself:

- They state what decides whether the product is in a healthy state and how the codeunits of the repository may depend on each
  other.
- They require that the documentation which describes the current state of the product agrees with what the source-code actually
  does. A document which describes an older state of the product is still a syntactically valid document, and neither the
  compiler nor the pipeline notices it. Without this a reader can not decide whether a sentence of the documentation is a fact
  about the product or a leftover of a state which does not exist anymore.
- They state how findings of code-reviews, security-checks, bug-searches, performance-analyses and similar analyses are
  documented. Without a single place and a single form for findings, every analysis writes its own list into its own document,
  the same finding is listed several times under different names, and nobody can tell which findings are still open.

## Requirements

### Requirement: "scbuildcodeunits" is the single source of truth for the state of the pipeline

The command `scbuildcodeunits` SHALL always be executable in this repository, and it SHALL succeed whenever the repository
is in a healthy state. Whether the pipeline of this product is green SHALL be decided by that command and by nothing else.

#### Scenario: A change is considered finished

- **WHEN** a change is considered finished
- **THEN** `scbuildcodeunits` has been executed on it and has succeeded

#### Scenario: Another tool reports a different result

- **WHEN** an IDE, a single manually executed step or any other tool reports a result which differs from the result of
  `scbuildcodeunits`
- **THEN** the result of `scbuildcodeunits` is the one which counts, and the deviation is treated as a defect of the other
  tool or of its configuration

### Requirement: A codeunit only accesses codeunits which it declares as its dependencies

A codeunit SHALL NOT access the source-code of another codeunit unless that other codeunit is declared as a dependent
codeunit in its `<codeunit-name>.codeunit.xml`. The codeunits of this repository are the folders which contain such a
codeunit-file.

#### Scenario: A codeunit needs functionality of another codeunit

- **WHEN** a codeunit needs functionality which another codeunit of this repository provides
- **THEN** that other codeunit is declared under `dependentcodeunits` in the codeunit-file, and its functionality is used
  through its build-result instead of through its source-code

#### Scenario: An undeclared access exists

- **WHEN** a codeunit reads, includes, compiles or references source-code of a codeunit which is not declared as its
  dependency
- **THEN** this is a defect, which is resolved either by declaring the dependency or by removing the access

### Requirement: Documentation which describes the current state agrees with the source-code

Every document of this repository which describes the current state of the product SHALL describe it the way the source-code of
the current branch implements it. The documents which this applies to are at least:

- `ReadMe.md` in the repository-root
- the `ReadMe.md` of every codeunit (the codeunits of this repository are the folders which contain a
  `<codeunit-name>.codeunit.xml`)
- `Contributing.md`
- everything below `Other/Reference`
- everything below `<codeunit>/Other/Reference/ReferenceContent`, especially `Hints.md`, `HowToBuild.md` and the articles
- the doc-comments in the source-code

#### Scenario: A document states something which the source-code does not do

- **WHEN** a document states a behaviour, a feature, a limitation, a default-value, a name or a path which the source-code does
  not implement that way
- **THEN** this is a defect of the same weight as a defect in the source-code, and it is resolved by correcting the document to
  the state which the source-code implements

#### Scenario: The documented state is the wanted state and the source-code is the wrong side

- **WHEN** the document describes what the product is supposed to do and the deviation is a defect of the source-code and not of
  the document
- **THEN** the document stays as it is and the deviation is reported as a defect of the source-code, because rewriting the
  document would hide that defect instead of documenting the product

### Requirement: Lists of features state the implemented state

Every list of features, capabilities, supported formats, supported platforms or supported options SHALL state for every entry
whether it is implemented, and that statement SHALL be the one which the source-code implements. An entry which is not
implemented SHALL stay in the list and be marked as not implemented instead of being removed, so that the list keeps working as
an overview of what is planned.

#### Scenario: A feature became implemented

- **WHEN** a feature which the documentation marks as not implemented - for example with "❌", with "planned", with "not
  implemented yet" or with a link to its issue - is implemented in the source-code
- **THEN** its entry is changed to the marking which this repository uses for an implemented feature, in the same shape as the
  other implemented entries of that list

#### Scenario: A feature was removed or never existed

- **WHEN** a feature which the documentation marks as implemented does not exist in the source-code
- **THEN** its entry is corrected, so that no reader expects a function which the product does not have

#### Scenario: A feature exists but is not listed

- **WHEN** the source-code implements a feature which such a list does not contain although the list claims to be complete for
  its topic
- **THEN** the feature is added to the list

### Requirement: Lists of bugs, findings and technical debts contain only entries which still exist

Every list of known bugs, known limitations, security-findings, technical debts or open points SHALL contain only entries which
still exist in the source-code, and every entry SHALL describe the state which the source-code has now.

The findings-table in the section `## Findings` in `Other/Reference/Reference.md` is the exception: it is maintained as
specified in the requirements on findings below, which keep fixed findings and mark them as fixed.

#### Scenario: A documented finding was fixed

- **WHEN** a bug, a finding or a technical debt which such a list contains is not present in the source-code anymore
- **THEN** its entry is removed from that list, so that nobody spends time on a problem which does not exist anymore
- **AND** if the entry is a row of the findings-table, it is not removed but its state is set to `fixed`, as the
  requirements on findings below require

#### Scenario: A documented finding is still open but changed

- **WHEN** an entry of such a list is still present in the source-code, but the source-code changed in a way which makes the
  description, the named location or the named severity of the entry wrong
- **THEN** the entry stays and its description is corrected

### Requirement: Instructions and references of the documentation resolve

Every command, task, path, file-name, class-name, configuration-key and cross-reference which a document names SHALL exist and
SHALL work in the state of the repository which that document belongs to.

#### Scenario: A document names something which does not exist

- **WHEN** a document names a file, a folder, a command, a task, a class or a configuration-key which does not exist or which was
  renamed
- **THEN** the document is corrected to the name which exists, or the statement is removed if the named thing does not exist
  anymore at all

### Requirement: Checking the specifications includes checking this documentation

Whenever it is checked whether the specifications of this repository are still up to date, the documents named in this
specification SHALL be checked against the source-code in the same run, and every deviation which is found SHALL be corrected in
that run.

#### Scenario: The specifications are checked

- **WHEN** it is checked whether the specifications below `openspec/specs` still agree with the source-code
- **THEN** the documents named in this specification are checked against the source-code as well and the deviating ones are
  adjusted, so that after such a check the documentation is up to date and not only the specifications

#### Scenario: A change is considered finished

- **WHEN** a change of the source-code is considered finished
- **THEN** the documents which describe what that change touched have been updated together with it and not in a later separate
  step

### Requirement: Documents which record the past are not adjusted

A document which records what was true at a point in time SHALL NOT be adjusted to the current state. This applies to the
changelog-files below `Other/Resources/Changelog`, to the log-files below `Other/Logs` and to the archived changes below
`openspec/changes/archive`.

#### Scenario: A record of the past does not describe the current state

- **WHEN** an entry of a changelog, of a log-file or of an archived change describes a state which the product does not have
  anymore
- **THEN** the entry stays unchanged, because it documents what was true when it was written, and changing it would destroy the
  history instead of documenting the product

### Requirement: Findings are collected in one table

Every finding of a code-review, a security-check, a bug-search, a performance-analysis or any other analysis of this repository SHALL be recorded in the table of the section `## Findings` in `Other/Reference/Reference.md`.
Findings SHALL NOT be recorded in any other document.
If the section or the table does not exist yet, it SHALL be created.

#### Scenario: An analysis produces findings

- **WHEN** an analysis of this repository produces findings
- **THEN** every finding is added as a row to the table in the section `## Findings` in `Other/Reference/Reference.md`, and no separate list of findings is written anywhere else

#### Scenario: A list of findings is found in another document

- **WHEN** a document of this repository other than `Other/Reference/Reference.md` contains findings
- **THEN** these findings are moved into the table and removed from the place where they were
- **AND** if that document has no actual content left afterwards, it is deleted together with every reference to it, unless it is `ReadMe.md` of the repository, the `ReadMe.md` of a codeunit, `<codeunit>/Other/Reference/ReferenceContent/Hints.md` or `<codeunit>/Other/Reference/ReferenceContent/index.md`, which stay even when they are empty

### Requirement: Findings have an id with a prefix and an ascending number

Every finding SHALL have an id of the form `<prefix>-<ascending number>`.
The prefix SHALL be chosen by the first of the following rules which applies:

1. `SEC` if the finding is relevant for security.
2. `BUG` if the finding is a bug.
3. `PER` if the finding has an impact on performance.
4. `OTH` for every other finding.

The number SHALL be ascending per prefix, written without leading zeros (for example `SEC-1` or `SEC-12`, but not `SEC-01`), and an id SHALL never be reused for another finding, not even after the finding was fixed.

#### Scenario: A new finding is added

- **WHEN** a new finding is added to the table
- **THEN** its prefix is determined by the rules above in their order, and its number is the highest number already used with that prefix plus one

#### Scenario: A finding which already has an id is moved into the table

- **WHEN** a finding which already has an id is moved into the table
- **THEN** its id is kept if possible, and only an id which does not fit the form or which collides with an existing id is replaced by a new one which fits the form

### Requirement: The findings-table has fixed columns

The table SHALL have exactly the following columns in this order:

- `Id`: the id of the finding.
- `State`: the state of the finding, which is `open`, `partially fixed` or `fixed`; another state is only used if none of these three applies, and the reason for it is written into `Notes`.
- `Description`: what the finding is.
- `Impact`: what the finding causes, depending on its topic, for example the security-impact or the performance-impact.
- `Notes`: every further information, especially the content of further columns which a list of findings had before it was moved into the table.

#### Scenario: A list of findings has further columns

- **WHEN** a list of findings which is moved into the table has columns other than the ones above
- **THEN** the content of these columns is written into `Notes` instead of adding further columns to the table

### Requirement: The state of a finding is determined from the source-code

The state of a finding SHALL be determined by checking the source-code itself, not by documentation or comments.
A fixed finding SHALL NOT be removed from the table; its state SHALL be set to `fixed` instead.
The id of a finding SHALL be struck through (for example `~~SEC-2~~`) if and only if its state is `fixed`, and no other cell of the table SHALL ever be struck through.

#### Scenario: A finding was fixed

- **WHEN** the source-code shows that a finding is not present anymore
- **THEN** the row stays in the table, its state is set to `fixed` and its id is struck through

#### Scenario: A finding is still present

- **WHEN** the source-code shows that a finding is still present completely or partially
- **THEN** its state is `open` or `partially fixed` and its id is not struck through

### Requirement: The findings-section is formatted

After the findings-section was changed, the whole section SHALL be formatted according to the `format-markdown-file`-skill.

#### Scenario: The findings-table was changed

- **WHEN** a row of the findings-table was added or changed
- **THEN** the whole section `## Findings` is formatted, including the padding of the table-cells
